# Node-Express REST API Template

## CRUD Operations using REST APIs in Node.js and Express.js

This is a standard Template for creating a RESTful API for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js and Express.js. The API interacts with a simple in-memory data store, simulating a library scenario for managing a set of courses.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chiragdhameja/template-node-express-postgres-typeorm-docker.git
cd template-node-express-postgres-typeorm-docker
```

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

Start the server with the following command:

```

The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can specify a different port by setting the PORT environment variable.
